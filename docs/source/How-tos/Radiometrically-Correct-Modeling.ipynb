By preconditioning the input, we can make FFT operating on the input satisfy Parseval's theorem.  The aperture is an amplitude, so it requires scaling by $\\sqrt{N}$ in addition to a similarly square-rooted change to what we did to get a peak of 1.

The destruction of high frequencies via the crop implicit in computing a $Q=2$ field with $< 2*N$ samples results in spatial domain ringing.
