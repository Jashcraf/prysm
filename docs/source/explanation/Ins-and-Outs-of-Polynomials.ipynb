    "The grid distortion trick provided out-of-the-box for annular apertures is very easy to implement and use for an annulus, and similarly easy for an ellipse.  More complex aperture shapes such as hexagons are less straightforward to derive a grid distortion for.  For these use cases, or to provide an alternative orthogonalization approach for annular apertures, prysm features a QR factorization based orthogonalization approach over an arbitrary aperture.  This is similar to performing a Gram-Schmidt process.  We'll repeat the annular example first:"

    "The similarity of the power, coma, and trefoil modes and dissimilarity of the higher order mode highlight a property of all polynomials: they are extremely similar, and largely irrespective of the domain for lower order modes.  Higher order modes will distort significantly to match any given domain.  If you are largely interested in lower order behaviors, orthogonality will likely not matter to you.  It is only when concerned with higher order modes that orthogonality will be of significance.\n",
    "\n",
    "An additional property of using QR factorization, Gram-Schmidt, SVD, or other processes to produce orthogonal bases is that the output mode shapes depends on every detail of the inputs.  If the input basis changes, for example expanding Z1-Z11 in one case and Z1-Z36 in another, the output changes.  Similarly, the normalization radius of the input Zernikes (if those are used) must be specified consistently, as well as the exact centering between the polynomials and the aperture.  When the grid distortion techniques shown previously for annular apertures are used, the only relevant one of these effects is grid centering, which only impacts orthogonality and not mode shapes."
