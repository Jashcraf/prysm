New Features
============

The polynomials module has gained support for the dickson polynomials of the first and second kind:

* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.dickson1`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.dickson1_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.dickson2`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.dickson1_sequence`

First derivatives of jacobi polynomials are also now available:

* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.jacobi_der`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.jacobi_der_sequence`


These are usefor for applications such as raytracing.
