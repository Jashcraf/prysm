New Features
============

The polynomials module has gained support for the dickson polynomials of the first and second kind, and Chebyshev polynomials of the third and Fourth kind:

* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.dickson1`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.dickson1_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.dickson2`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.dickson1_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby3`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby3_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby4`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby4_sequence`

First derivatives of jacobi polynomials and their descendants are also now available:

* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.jacobi_der`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.jacobi_der_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby1_der`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby1_der_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby2_der`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby2_der_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby3_der`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby3_der_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby4_der`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.cheby4_der_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.zernike_der`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.zernike_der_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.Qbfs_der`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.Qbfs_der_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.Qcon_der`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.Qcon_der_sequence`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.Q2d_der`
* :func:`~prysm.polynomials.Q2d_der_sequence`

These are usefor for applications such as raytracing.

The performance Jacobi polynomial computations has been increased by 18%.  This cascades to performance of Chebyshev, Legendre, and Zernike polynomials.  The increase comes from replacing an outdated recurrence relation for one expressed in the standard form, which happens to be a bit faster.
