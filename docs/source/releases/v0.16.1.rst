prysm v0.16.1
*************

This release has reconfigured readthedocs.org settings, preventing build
failures from increased memory usage.  It also includes a bugfix to the welch
window application for PSD calculations and a new example (defocus and contrast
inversion) in the documentation.  This new example and the image based wavefront
sensing example are now precompiled to reduce load on the RTD servers.
