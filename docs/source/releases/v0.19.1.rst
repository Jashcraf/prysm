prysm v0.19.1
*************

v0.19.1 is primarily a bugfix release, but includes some small quality of life
changes.  Users are advised that v0.20 will bring a sweeping round of breaking
changes; the final such round before version 1 is released.  Version 1 will only
contain breaking changes that polish the v0.20 API and no major rewrites or
restructuring.

New Features
============

- :class:`~prysm.propagation.Wavefront` now has :code:`intensity` and
  :code:`phase` properties.  These are convenience methods that return a new
  :code:`Wavefront` with its data set to :code:`abs()^2` and :code:`angle` of
  the reciever's data, respectively.
- :func:`~prysm.io.read_zygo_datx` now properly understands files which have
  phase units of nm.

Bug fixes
=========

- :func:`~prysm.fttools.pad2d` is now properly FFT-aligned.
- :func:`~prysm.fttools.MatrixDFTExecutor` has had its normalization coefficient
  corrected and now produces correct scaling in all cases, if the output plane's
  support is smaller than the computation region.  This is an improvement to
  before, which had a scaling error of Q and the ratio of input and ouptut
  (linear) sizes.
- Matrix DFTs have been type stabilized, they no longer result in double
  precision output for single precision input.
- The sample spacing property has been made friendly to GPU array libraries
  which produce arrays of shape (1,) for scalar operations.


Breaking changes
================

- :func:`~prysm.fttools.pad2d` is now shifted two samples for odd-sized inputs
  compared to v0.19.
- :func:`~prysm.mtf_utils.plot_mtf_vs_field` has been rewritten, and now
  requires seaborn as a dependency.
- Fixed sampling propagations now always use unitary matrix DFTs.  The meaning
  of "unitary" is that they satisfy Parseval's theorem.
