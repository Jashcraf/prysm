***********
prysm v0.16
***********

This release has been largely focused on updating the internals of prysm and
brings relatively new features.  The bulk of the work in this release has been
spent on reworking the :mod:`~prysm.mathops` module for a cleaner and more
extensible design and on rewriting the guts of the convolutional code.  The
result is a slimmer library with cleaner code, faster execution, and higher
accuracy results.  Users are encouraged to upgrade, particularly for the
enhancements made to image simulations done based on the convolution engine.

New Features
============

* :func:`prysm.coordinates.make_xy_grid` and
  :func:`~prysm.coordinates.make_rho_phi_grid` now take a :code:`radius`
  argument.

* :class:`~prysm.objects.TiltedSquare`:code:`.__init__` now takes :code:`radius`
  and :code:`contrast` arguments.

* :func:`prysm.io.read_sigfit_zernikes` function to read Zernike coefficients
  from `SigFit <http://sigmadyne.com/sigfit-software/>`_ :code:`OUTCOF3` files.

* :func:`prysm.io.read_sigfit_rigidbody` function to read rigid body motion and
  radius error coefficients from SigFit :code:`SUM2` files.

* :meth:`prysm.interferogram.Interferogram.pad` function to pad interferograms;
  useful for dealing with group delay from spatial filtering.

* :func:`~prysm.thinlens.object_to_image_dist` to calculate an object distance
  given a focal length and image distance.

* New :class:`~prysm.convolution.ConvolutionEngine` which allows users to
  control the execution flow of a convolution, adjust the data in k-space before
  returning to the spatial domain, and other advanced features.  For more
  information see the updated User's Guide.  Several bugs have been squashed in
  the process of making these upgrades.

* :mod:`prysm.degredations` for modeling degredations in the image chain.
  :class:`~orysm.degredations.Smear` and :class:`~prysm.degredations.Jitter` are
  its first members.  They are also exported at the top level of the library.

* :class:`~prysm.objects.Chirp` to synthesize chirped frequency targets.

* :class:`~prysm.objects.Grating` to synthesize grating targets.

* :class:`~prysm.objects.GratingArray` to synthesize arrays of gratings.

* the :code:`radius` argument is exposed on
  :class:`~prysm.objects.SiemensStar`:code:`.__init__`.

* :func:`~prysm.interferogram.fit_psd` to fit analytic curves to PSD data.  Note
  that this function works best when given a reasonable guess; curve fitting
  extremely high dynamic range signals (such as PSDs) is not very stable.

Breaking changes
================

* the :attr:`unit_x` and :attr:`unit_y` attributes on the BasicData class have
  been renamed to :attr:`x` and :attr:`y`.  :attr:`unit_x` and :attr:`unit_y`
  are provided as properties with warnings until v0.17.

* :code:`analytic_ft` functions no longer calculate the meshgrid of x and y
  inputs internally.  This makes output shapes and types consistent with input
  (i.e., calling :code:`.analytic_ft(0,0)` will return a float instead of a
  :code:`(1,1)` shape ndarray).  Performance is also improved by removing
  redundant gridding operations.

Bugfixes
========

* :meth:`~prysm.convolution.Convolvable.conv` now produces the correct number of
  output samples in all cases.  Fixes #3.

* unit changes have been corrected - prior results were incorrect.

* the :code:`norm` kwarg has improved behavior for Zernike classes, no longer
  setting :code:`z.normalize = True` when the :code:`norm=False` kwarg is
  passed.

* an error is no longer raised when calling
  :meth:`prysm.convolution.Convolvable.save` with :code:`nbits=8`.

* calls to :meth:`prysm.pupil.Pupil.mask` now properly capture the mask for
  application to the :code:`fcn` property.

* units on PSD plots are now properly referenced to spatial and phase units, not
  nm.  This fix affects axis labels, not data.

Under-the-hood Changes
======================

* :attr:`prysm.pupil.Pupil.strehl` now uses a more accurate formula.

* the :mod:`prysm.mathops` module has been reworked, and its use throughout the
  library adjusted in concert with this change.

* :func:`prysm.propagation.prop_pupil_plane_to_psf_plane` performance has been
  improved when Q=1.

* some functions have had their conformance with :attr:`prysm.config.precision`
  improved.

* the performance of :meth:`prysm.detector.OLPF.analytic_ft` has been improved.
