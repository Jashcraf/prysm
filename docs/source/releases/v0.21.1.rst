prysm v0.21.1
*************

Version 0.21.1 is a minor point release that addresses the following issues:

* Some unit tests related to scaling of matrix DFTs were failing
* A unit test related to slice centering was failing

There was also an undocumented change introduced in v0.21, which is documented here in the v0.21.1 release notes.

The scaling for matrix DFTs has changed once again, this time to exactly match the scaling described in Soummer et al.  As collateral changes, FFTs now use :code:`norm='unitary'` which scales both forward FFT and inverse FFT by :code:`1/sqrt(N)`.  The change to FFT based propagations is to allow matrix DFTs and FFTs to be equal in terms of scaling.  The :doc:`Radiometric Scaling docs <../how-tos/Radiometrically-Correct-Modeling>` have been updated to reflect the new scaling rules.  This scaling change is likely the last breaking change to the portion of prysm which is outside the experimental folder.

For the large number of new features in the v0.21 series, and no stability policy see the :doc:`v0.20 release notes<./v0.21>`.
