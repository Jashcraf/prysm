prysm v0.14
***********

Version 0.14 introduces a host of new features and critical improvements to
existing features of prysm.  Users are encouraged to upgrade from prior
releases.

With version 0.15, work will continue on improving the documentation and tests.
When documentation becomes "complete" and coverage exceeds 90%, version 1.0 will
be released and prysm will follow more typical semver release patterns.

New Features
============

* :func:`~prysm.fttools.pad2d` from :mod:`prysm.fttools` now takes the
  :code:`mode` kwarg, wrapping `numpy.pad
  <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy-1.15.1/reference/generated/numpy.pad.html>`_
  in the non-constant case.

* :func:`~prysm.propagation.prop_pupil_plane_to_psf_plane` now takes the
  :code:`incoherent` (default :code:`True`) argument.  When
  :code:`incoherent=False`, the (complex-valued) coherent impulse response is
  returned.

* wrap-around effects in convolutions have been reduced.

* there is a new :func:`~prysm.geometry.truecircle` mask in
  :mod:`prysm.geometry` which has anti-aliased edges for improved simulation
  accuracy.

* :func:`~prysm.io.read_mtfmapper_sfr_single` function in :mod:`prysm.io` to
  read outputs from `MTF Mapper <http://mtfmapper.blogspot.com/>`_ with the
  :code:`-f --single-roi` arguments.

* :attr:`semidiameter` attr on :class:`~prysm._phase.OpticalPhase` class and
  subclasses (:class:`FringeZernike`, :class:`Interferogram`, ...).

* :code:`show_colorbar` option on :meth:`~prysm._phase.OpticalPhase.plot2d`.

* all masks in :mod:`prysm.geometry` now take a :code:`radius` argument.

* :meth:`prysm.interferogram.Interferogram.mask` now takes descriptive
  arguments, e.g. :code:`i.mask('circle', diameter=100)` for a 100mm diameter
  circle.  The :code:`mask` kwarg still exists for user-provided masks.

* :attr:`prysm.interferogram.Interferogram.pvr` for PVr analysis.

* in :mod:`prysm.fringezernike`: :func:`fzname` function to return the name of
  the nth Fringe Zernike with :code:`base` (0 or 1).

* :func:`fzset_to_magnitude_angle` function to convert a list of (X-Y) Zernikes
  to (magnitude-angle) form.

* :attr:`FringeZernike.magnitudes` property to access
  :func:`fzset_to_magnitude_angle` on a :class:`FringeZernike` instance.

* :meth:`~prysm.fringezernike.FringeZernike.top_n` method for
  :class:`FringeZernike` pupils to list the top n coefficients by magnitude.

* :meth:`~prysm.fringezernike.FringeZernike.barplot` method for
  :class:`FringeZernike` pupils to plot their coefficients.

* :meth:`~prysm.fringezernike.FringeZernike.barplot_magnitudes` method to plot
  their pairwise magnitudes (e.g, one bar for primary astigmatism).

* :meth:`~prysm.fringezernike.FringeZernike.barplot_topn` method to plot the top
  n coefficients only.

* :meth:`~prysm.fringezernike.FringeZernike.truncate` method to reduce
  :class:`FringeZernike` pupils to the first n terms.

* :meth:`~prysm.fringezernike.FringeZernike.truncate_topn` method to reduce to
  top n terms.

* :attr:`~prysm.detector.Detector.fs` and
  :attr:`~prysm.detector.Detector.nyquist` properties on the
  :class:`~prysm.detector.Detector` class for the sampling and nyquist
  frequencies in cy/mm.

* :code:`crossed` parameter in :class:`~prysm.objects.SlantedEdge` constructor
  to produce a "BMW target"

* :func:`~prysm.interferogram.ab_psd` function in :mod:`prysm.interferogram` for
  inverse power law PSD curves.

Breaking Changes
================

* :code:`rms_norm` in functions related to Zernikes has been renamed to
  :code:`norm`.  This affects the :func:`~prysm.fringezernike.fit` function from
  :mod:`prysm.fringezernike` as well as the :class:`FringeZernike` class.

* :code:`num_terms` on the :func:`fit` function is now renamed to :code:`terms`.

* :code:`num_spokes` on :class:`~prysm.objects.SiemensStar` has been renamed to
  :code:`spokes`.

* :code:`num_pts` on :func:`prysm.otf.diffraction_limited_mtf` has been renamed
  to :code:`samples`.

* :code:`num_samples` has been renamed to :code:`samples` in
  :func:`prysm.propagation.pupil_sample_to_psf_sample` and
  :func:`~prysm.propagation.psf_sample_to_pupil_sample`.

* the :code:`epd` keyword argument on :class:`~prysm.pupil.Pupil` instances has
  been renamed to :code:`dia`.  This also affects the :class:`FringeZernike` and
  :class:`Seidel` subclasses.

* :meth:`prysm.interferogram.Interferogram.plot_psd_xyavg` has been renamed to
  :code:`plot_psd_xy_avg`.

Under-the-hood Changes
======================

* :attr:`samples_x`, :attr:`samples_y`, :attr:`center_x`, and :attr:`center_y`
  are now properties of :class:`~prysm._phase.OpticalPhase` instances
  (:class:`Pupils`, :class:`Interferograms`, ...) instead of attrs.  This helps
  eliminate synchronization problems when the data is modified.

* :code:`imwrite` is used from imageio, not :code:`imsave` to follow best
  practice.

* :func:`~prysm.geometry.circle` from :mod:`prysm.geometry` is now exported at
  the top level.

* :class:`~prysm.detector.Detector` now defaults to 16-bit precision.

* import of :code:`h5py` for datx files is now deferred for faster imports of
  prysm.

* :code:`matplotlib` is now an optional dependency and its import is deferred
  for faster imports of prysm.

* :class:`~prysm._phase.OpticalPhase` now provides default values for
  :attr:`xaxis_label`, :attr:`yaxis_label`, and :attr:`zaxis_label` to avoid
  errors on subclasses.  Users should still provide better values for
  subclasses.

* :class:`~prysm.geometry.MaskCache` argument order has changed from
  :code:`samples, shape` to :code:`shape, samples, radius`.

* data from Zygo datx files is now flipped to maintain consistent orientation
  with the representation in Mx.

* in :mod:`prysm._zernikes`, :code:`Tip (Y)` has been renamed :code:`Tilt Y`.
  :code:`Tilt (X)` has been renamed :code:`Tilt X`.

* the :attr:`coefs` attr on :class:`FringeZernike` instances is now a numpy
  array.  Piston tip and tilt can be suppressed by invoking :code:`fz.coefs[:3]
  = 0; fz.build(); fz.mask(fz._mask, fz._mask_target);`.

* PSD calculation has been rewritten.  PSD results are now properly normalized
  to be a true PSD.  Prior results should be considered in error.

Bugfixes
========

* fix :meth:`prysm.convolution.Convolvable.show` errors when no xlim or ylim
  provided.

* fix :attr:`OpticalPhase.samples_x` and :attr:`samples_y` lookup.

* coefficients from :func:`prysm.fringezernike.fit` are no longer transposed in
  the Cartesian plane.

* calling :meth:`Interferogram.crop` with data spanning the entire array no
  longer causes an error.

* Initializing an :class:`Interferogram` with no :code:`meta` dictionary no
  longer causes an error.
