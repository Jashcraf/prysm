prysm v1.0

intro paragraph about 1.0

New Features
============

This release brings the following new major features:

* Forward modeling of Shack Hartmann wavefront sensors

* Compositing and per-segment errors of "keystone" apertures


Performance Optimizations
=========================

* :func:`~prysm.geometry.rectangle` has been optimized when the rotation angle is zero

* :func:`~prysm.propagation.angular_spectrum_transfer_function` has been slightly optimized

Bug Fixes
=========

* The sign of `:func:~prysm.propagation.Wavefront.thin_lens` was incorrect, requiring a propagation by the negative of the focal length to go to the focus.  The sign has been swapped; (wf * thin_lens(f, ...)).free_space(f) now goes to the focus.
