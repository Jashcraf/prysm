    "# Polarized Propagation\n",
    "This is a brief how-to on how to use prysm's polarized propagation feature. Users should already be familiar with [Jones Calculus](../tutorials/Jones-Calculus.ipynb), and the [First Diffraction Model](../tutorials/First-Diffraction-Model.ipynb) before going through this how-to. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we step outside of the classroom and into the laboratory, we discover that things are not always perfect. In an ideal world, a polarizer is a perfect polarizer, and the degree to which it polarizes doesn't change across the optic. In reality, manufacturing defects can complicate our optical system by introducing unwanted effects. In this how-to, we cover how `prysm` can help you model spatially-varying polarization optics in diffraction problems with polarized field propagation.\n",
    "\n",
    "We begin with a simple extension of the Jones Matrix $\\mathbf{J}$ into the spatial domain:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mathbf{J}(x,y) =\n",
    "\\begin{pmatrix}\n",
    "J_{xx}(x,y) & J_{xy}(x,y) \\\\\n",
    "J_{yx}(x,y) & J_{yy}(x,y) \\\\\n",
    "\\end{pmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "All this means is that we consider $\\mathbf{J}$ to be a function that varies with position across a given optical element. In `prysm`, polarization-modifying components are simply arrays of dimension `(M,N,2,2)`, which allows their effect to vary spatially, as shown for the case of a linear retarder below."
