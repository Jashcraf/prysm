    "We can see that at first blush, the process does not duplicate itself.  This is because of the IIR nature of the PSF.  The destruction of high frequencies via the crop implicit in computing a $Q=2$ field with $< 2*N$ samples results in spatial domain ringing.  This ringing has resulted in the pupil being 0.0003 dimmer in its total energy, likely due to a small amount of energy cast outside the computational window.  There is also a ~10% overshoot in the maximum value.\n",
