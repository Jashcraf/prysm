That convention includes an inner division by $\\sqrt{N\\,}$, where N is the number of elements in the array.  Since we desire a peak of 1, we can use Parseval's theorem and simply divide the output array by the sum of the aperture (i.e., the sum of the power in the input beam).  Combine that with undoing the normalization done internally by multiplying by $\\sqrt{N\\,}$: "

The destruction of high frequencies via the crop implicit in computing a $Q=2$ field with $< 2*N$ samples results in spatial domain ringing.  This ringing has resulted in the pupil being minutely dimmer in its total energy, due to the energy that was outside the computed window.  There is also a ~10% overshoot in the maximum value.\n",
