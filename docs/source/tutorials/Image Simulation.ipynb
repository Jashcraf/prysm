This combines previously shown concepts in the [Lens MTF Model](./Lens-MTF-Model.ipynb) with a few additional ones and is a more advanced tutorial.  The reader is assumed to understand basic propagation for computing PSFs.\n",

    "From these, we begin to determine the parameters of the forward model.  The model _must_ be at least Nyquist sampled, or due to aliasing it will be invalid.  We define:\n",

    "$$\n",
    "Q = \\frac{\\lambda \\text{F\\#}}{pp}\n",

    "where $pp$ is the pixel pitch, and compute $Q = \\tfrac{2.8 * .495}{4.5} = 0.306$.  495 nm is 10% below 550 nm.  Since we require $Q>=2$ in the forward model, and assume at the moment that we will use an integer level of oversampling, then the forward model is run at $Q=\\text{roundup}\\{2/.306\\}=7x$ oversampling, or $Q=2.156$.  A notable problem is that this equation for $Q$ contains the wavelength; in other words, $Q$ is chromatic.  To get around this, we'll use matrix triple product DFTs to propagate directly to the oversampled version of the detector grid, which will be 3584x3584 samples across."

We've used the smallest possible grid that can contain the pupil with no padding, and a large number of samples.  A requirement of the matrix triple product DFT is that the output resolution, divided by Q, must not exceed the input resolution.  If this is not honored, then Dirichlet clones of the PSF will be visible in the edge of the array, which is unphysical and incorrect.  Since we will have 3584 px on the output and Q~=2.1, we need about 1800 px on the input,"
