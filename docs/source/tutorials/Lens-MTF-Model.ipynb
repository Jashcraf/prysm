    "# Lens MTF Model\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we will show how to use prysm to model the MTF of a lens based on a polynomial model of its aberrations.  We will utilize the concepts from the [First Diffraction Model](./First-Diffraction-Model.ipynb) tutorial in constructing the forward model.\n",
    "\n",
    "MTF is defined as the magnitude of the Fourier transform of the Point Spread Function (PSF), normalized by its value at the origin.  Without writing the normalization, that is simply:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\text{MTF}\\left(\\nu_x,\\nu_y\\right) = \\left| \\mathfrak{F}\\left[\\text{PSF}\\left(x,y\\right)\\right] \\right| $$\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this tutorial a bit more interesting, we will use an N-sided aperture, as if our lens were stopped down and has a finite number of aperture blades.  We will also assume no vignetting.  Instead of Hopkins' polynomials as used previously, we will use Zernike polynomials which are orthogonal over the unit disk.  Everything scales with F/#, but we'll assume its 8 and the focal length is 50 mm as reasonable photographic examples."

    "We will assume for the moment that the illumination is monochromatic, as a separate tutorial deals with polychromatic propagation.  We will also assume the correction of the lens is so-so at its maximum aperture of F/1.4, and decide somewhat arbitrarily that it improves by 20% for each stop the F/# is reduced.  F/1.4 to F/8 is 5 stops, so we have 1.2^5 reduction in wavefront error.  There is no physical basis for these assumptions, but they are being made by the user, not the library."
